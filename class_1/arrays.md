# Hello there

We are going to learn about a data structure you know
And it is one you often refer to, but likely incorrectly. Are you excited?


# Array

Yes, Array.

Well... you said const a = []
hurts. sorry.

if const a = [] isn't an array, what is it?

Well by the end of this section we can empirically tell what it is.

# Let's play with arrays

First a moment on the whiteboard. Then to the node!


# Let's talk about arrays

> Covering: Let's practice our BigO!!

- What are arrays
- Getting at specific index
- Insertion at specific index
- Deletion at specific index


# Arrays

> They are fixed size, contiguous memory chunks

- That means you can't grow it.
- There are no `insertAt` or `push` or `pop`. Doesn't mean you can't write those though.
